                        <div><p class="geninfopara2">We strongly recommend that you travel as light as possible. Please bring only limited luggage i.e. one medium sized suitcase per person and one additional hand bag to keep inside the coach. Do not bring blankets and bedding.</p>
                            <p>It is important to note that all cities are prone to thefts and bag snatching, tourists especially being the most vulnerable. We suggest you to take extra care of your belongings while on tour especially at Railway Station, hotels, restaurants and all sight-seeing places. While you are on train journey, we advise you to carry a chain and lock to secure your luggage. Baggage at all times and in all circumstances, is the sole responsibility of the passenger and our company will not be liable for any losses occurred while on tour.</p>
